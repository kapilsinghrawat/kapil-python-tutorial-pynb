Python is a great general-purpose programming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first released in 1991 but later with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.

### Python Setup and Usage

Look at [general information on the setup of the Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) on different platforms. 



### Basic data types

Python has numbers of data type that include integers, floats, booleans and strings.

lets have a quick look how to use these data types in below examples.



1. Number : this include integers and floats

   ```
      # Integer data type  
      eip = 3
      print (type (eip)) #print data type
      print (eip)        #print eip value
      print (eip+1)      #Add 1 in eip value
      print (eip-1)      #Subtract 1 in eip value 
      print (eip*2)      #Multiple 2 in eip value
      print (eip**2)     #Exponantiation 2 in eip value 

      eip +=2
      print (eip)
      eip *=2
      print (eip)

      # Float data type
      mlblr = 2.5
      print(type (y))

      print (y, (y+2), (y*2), (y/2), (y**2))


   ```

   Note: Python does not support unary increment and decrement operators (x++, ++x, x-- etc)

2. Boolean: Python uses English words (or, and, not) rather than symbols for Boolean logic (||, &&, !)

   ```
   EIP = True
   MLBLR = False

   print (type(EIP))

   print (EIP or MLBLR)
   print (not MLBLR)
   print (EIP and MLBLR) 
   print (EIP != MLBLR)
   ```
